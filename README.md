PyTupleSpace
============

A cloud ready TupleSpace using Python.

PyTupleSpace aims to provide a place for dynamic and loosely coupled interaction and exchange of objects in a distributed system such as the internet.

It implements a tuple space where the interface is defined and implemented using web services rather than being
language dependent, but provides bindings on to Python and JavaScript as starting point. 

It uses mongodb for storage, both for its ability to scale horizontally and for its natural support for tuple-like data structures.
